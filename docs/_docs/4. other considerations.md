While this micro-site focuses on the functionality and performance of the validation libraries, this should not be the _only_ information driving a choice.

Things to also consider are:

- Is the project in active development? When was its last release?
  Projects that aren't active come with their own set of issues, especially around bug & security fixes, or dependency updates.
  The following projects under test seem to be inactive at the time of writing:
  - `Justify`: Last released Nov, 2020.
  - `Medeia`: Last released Jun, 2019.
  - `Everit`: Deprecated. Replaced by the `Skema` implementation.
- What dependencies does it bring in? Less being more. 
  For example, Vert.x brings in Netty as a dependency, which seems unnecessary.
- Size of the library's jar file and its dependencies.
- Is the implementation fit for purpose. 
  For example, the `Snow` implementation documents itself as a reference implementation.
  (This may go some way to explain its poor performance).
