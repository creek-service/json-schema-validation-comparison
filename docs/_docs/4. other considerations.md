While this micro-site focuses on the functionality and performance of the validation libraries, this should not be the _only_ information driving a choice.

Things to also consider are:

- Is the project in active development? When was its last release?
  The `Project activity` column on the [Libraries under test table]({% link _docs/1. implementations.md %}) attempts to show this, 
  but relies on someone updating the site if a project beings inactive. 
  Projects that aren't active come with their own set of issues, especially around bug & security fixes, or dependency updates.
- What dependencies does it bring in? Less being more. 
  For example, Vert.x brings in Netty as a dependency, which seems unnecessary.
- Size of the library's jar file and its dependencies.
  The `Jar size` column on the [Libraries under test table]({% link _docs/1. implementations.md %}) shows the size of the library's primary jar, 
  but does not _yet_ include the size of any other dependencies this brings in. 
- Is the implementation fit for purpose. 
  For example, the `Snow` implementation documents itself as a reference implementation.
  (This may go some way to explain its poor performance).
  Another example is the `Vertx` implementation, which doesn't seem to provide anyway to control how remote references are loaded.
